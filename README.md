# MODBUS-and-SCADA
MODBUS protocol developed in C for PIC microcontroller based on the protocol documentation. The microcontroller comunicates with a SCADA software on a computer by a RS485/USB interface communicator. The report is in portuguese, where the prototype is described together with some images of the signals obtained. The main routine exemplifies a application where tha analog input of the PIC is used to control some temperature. The video shows the prototype working. The instrumets were provided by UTFPR.
